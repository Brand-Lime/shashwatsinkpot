Here I come to make my words, besmeared with stern history of harassment and discrimination tolerated by LGBTQ community, pierce through the heart of every reader till their funniest topic of jokes converts to regretful feeling of revolution. Lots and lots of positive light emitted by us are needed to let the \u2018spectrum\u2019 scatter its all seven wonderful colours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The villains of all villains are decorated with utmost prestige by influenceable naive citizens of the world, and specially our countrymen. These unscrupulous, framed gilded as an image of religious leaders have control over the farthest vision of our sight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mastered our view so well with the ethics of spirituality from scriptures, that the apex judgement hall of our country, the Supreme Court, failed to make the humane love of LGBTQ community win over the illogical misconceptions of the <em>babas <\/em>till 2013. Well, not can a man more live<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>with lies, as for the end only truth suffice. Later the scriptures\u2019 ironical answers to all preachers, \u201c<em>Vikriti Evam Prakriti\u201d, <\/em>what seems unnatural is also natural, as brought up in the famous book of <em>kamasutra, <\/em>a full chapter upon homosexuality by Sage Vatsyayna and lastly the depiction of gay sex in Arthashastra by Chanakya were heavy enough to reverse the slope of the scale of justice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jubilant tears mixed with giggles of broadest smiles marched across the country, colouring all the streets in rainbow. Like a natural one, it didn\u2019t take more than a handful of happy moments to fade away. Constitutional justice given, social justice denied.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conservative \u2018civilised judges\u2019 with mindset of \u2018sex\u2019 as a taboo, couldn\u2019t accept the happiness of a newly discovered minority unlike the supreme and real ones who passed the righteous judgement from the apex court. The lack of literacy and sex education makes the nation pay a lot. Whenever has the dominance of majority influenced the choices of minors, a hundred paths to majoritarianism have invited the<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>illiterate sections of majority. Unknown to the most prevalent inspirers of local society, homosexuality, bisexualism and transgenderism still fear of their own being. Humans, the self-made kings of biosphere have hit the rock bottom of humanity in uncountable ways, with not accepting the queers, as one. The parents, who had to give birth to a human, always expected their young ones to be a male or a female. Imbecile scientific knowledge they had, didn\u2019t allow them to have just a \u2018human baby\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These imposed thoughts of mankind on man, urge me to repeat so relatable words by Wordsworth, \u201cwhat man has made of man\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hegemony of major sexuality over the minors can never lead to social harmony, but disintegration of the society.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The killing of girl child in womb is replaced by the assassination of character, respect and identity of the minor section of humans for their unique sexuality, which supposedly is unacceptable to the majority. Even dogs of different breeds tend to like each other and get along, unlike faithless us, who marginalised and tabooed transgender humans, before hypocritically preaching<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2018hypocrisy and humanity\u2019 on social media tweets. When sea shores cannot control tides, they let the waves taste the beaches, unlike us who\u2019d curse a million for things aren\u2019t in our control. Our sexual orientation possessed by us naturally, is imaged as our own choice, by the social road side judges of the world. Getting rid of fear requires either destruction or negotiation, with the later being a hard choice, it has compelled us to ruin the existence of transgender people. Our bounded sight, so limited to topics of backward caste, women, dark complexion, that the voice of Transgender community has rarely found its way to the issue of discrimination.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wiser one never regrets his deeds, then how come are transgender suppressed under their own identity of sexuality after every fight for their rights? Do they need to fight back, or the ones they are quarrelling with, need proper education?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Isolating them wasn\u2019t the least we could do, as trolling of the prejudiced has given the funniest laughter to society.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not satisfied with social torment, we have fallen to the deepest we can for<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>laughing at their being. A woman with the lap of mother Marry and a man with the boldness of a father, have so far made humorous memories joking about a transgender with all physical and mental characters of parenthood.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Existence of mankind had never been a man\u2019s choice, and neither was the course of our evolution. No one holds the command on a person\u2019s sexuality, but the nature. This fact and education seeks more limelight and sharing than the jokes based on sexuality, for betterment of our vision and society. Human\u2019s mind, falsely nurtured so well with deceitful lies, needs to understand and have the PRIDE for sexuality. Understanding of unstoppable formation of new communities should be endorsed for the sake of neighbourhood, rather ill-treating the one we never understood. Hundreds of pampered lies can be demolished if a single truth prevails with the logical explanation of natural spectaculars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Respect cannot be imposed but disrespect can be overlooked depending upon the wisdom of perceiver. Contempt in the name of sexuality is discourteous to the mother nature of yours. A fifth grade<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>student writing essays on \u2018unity in diversity\u2019, should not get his brain washed in the ocean of society, disunited over diversity in gender. A place united despite of its diversity, is always one step closer to the utopian society. The exuberant spectrum, tainted by the rustic environment invites the ideas of revolution for the freedom of love and prosperity of majesty. \u201cYou never change things by fighting the existing reality.\u201d The permission to love each other given by the supreme court lacked the judgement of society. Although loving is illegal no more, but it\u2019s hard to prosper what society forbids. People read articles on social media, not the constitution of India, therefore must we all unite to write the reforming ideas for recycling of the thoughts of revolution to make the society healthy for every being. Who are crazy enough to think they can change the world the ones to do that.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The grim of society, endorsed by numerical supremacy of any community has some way or the other, led to progressive suppression of the minors.
